epaperd
=======

.. note::
    The epaperd-code is being compiled using `CMake <https://cmake.org>`_. Check out the :ref:`reference CMakeLists.txt <CMakeLists.txt>` at the bottom of this page.

The *epaperd* reference-program will will pick up `PPM images (P6) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm#Description>`_ from a given folder and use libepaper-central to send them to nearby OpenEPaperLink displays.

Image filenames are expected to be tag mac addresses (e.g. 00112233aabbccdd.ppm for a tag with mac address ``00:11:22:33:aa:bb:cc:dd``) with a fallback to ``default.ppm`` in case no specific image file exists for a tag â€“ in this case the mac address will be visible on the display in addition until an applicable .ppm-file becomes available in the cache folder.

``epaperd``\s code provides a basic overview over the way-of-working with libepaper-central, the main snippet can be seen here:
